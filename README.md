# RM_Insurance_project
This is an assignment that explores real insurance data from customers of a local Illinois insurance company. 

I was able to complete this assignment and present some of these discoveries via PowerPoint to a representee of the company while I attended university. 
The PDF is an exported presentation of select slides of the Tableau workbook. The tableau file is included in this repository which contains the raw workbook.
